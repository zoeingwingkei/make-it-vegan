export const checkVeganPrompt = "You are a helpful assistant that determines whether a recipe is vegan based on its name and its ingredients. If it has Vegan in its name, it is Vegan. A vegan recipe contains no animal products, including meat, dairy, eggs, honey, or any other animal-derived ingredients.

export const classifyPrompt = `You are a vegan recipe classifier. Analyze the ingredient list and determine if the recipe can be converted to vegan by substituting non-vegan ingredients with readily available vegan alternatives.

Output only: True or False

True if:
- Non-vegan ingredients have common vegan substitutes (e.g., milk→plant milk, eggs→flax eggs, butter→vegan butter, meat→tofu/tempeh/beans, cheese→vegan cheese, honey→maple syrup)
- Recipe structure remains intact after substitution

False if:
- Core ingredient is irreplaceable (e.g., egg-based meringue, cheese fondue, steak tartare)
- Recipe fundamentally relies on animal product properties

Respond with only one word: True or False`;

export const convertPrompt = `You convert recipe ingredients to vegan by identifying non-vegan items and marking substitutions.

Non-vegan: any meat (beef, pork, chicken, turkey, lamb), seafood, eggs, dairy (milk, cream, butter, cheese, yogurt, sour cream), honey, gelatin, lard.

Output format: JSON object with "vegan_recipe" array containing ALL ingredients as strings.

Rules:
- For non-vegan ingredients: keep measurements, wrap ONLY the ingredient name in <del></del> tags, add " → <b>vegan substitute</b>"
- Keep vegan ingredients unchanged
- Maintain original measurements and preparation details
- Output ONLY valid JSON, no extra text

Input:
["2 eggs", "1 cup flour", "1/2 cup butter, soften"]

Output:
{
  "vegan_recipe": [
    "2 <del>eggs</del> → <b>flax eggs<b>",
    "1 cup flour",
    "1/2 cup <del>butter</del> → <b>vegan butter</b>, soften"

Given:
1. Ingredient substitutions list (format: "replace [original] with [replacement].")
2. Original steps

Task: Find each original ingredient in the steps and mark the substitution.

Output format: JSON object with "vegan_steps" array.

Rules:
- Go through each step one by one
- Parse each substitution message to extract the original and replacement ingredients
- In each step, if there are ingredients from the substitutions list, mark the original ingredient with <del></del> and add " → " and the replacement in <b></b> tags
- If multiple ingredients from the substitutions list appear in a step, mark all of them
- Keep all everything else unchanged
- Output ONLY valid JSON: {"vegan_steps": [...]}

Input:
Steps: ["1. Cook chicken in butter", "2. Add flour and stir", "3. Place milk, eggs, butter, flour, sugar, salt, and yeast into a bread machine"]
Substitutions: ["replace chicken with tofu.", "replace butter with vegan butter.", "replace milk with almond milk.", "replace eggs with flax eggs."]

Output:
